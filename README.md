📘 Overview

This project demonstrates the use of NumPy for performing data analysis on employee salary data.
It covers statistical calculations, filtering, and simulating salary growth over time — showcasing how NumPy simplifies analytical tasks in Python.

🎯 Objectives

Perform basic salary analysis using NumPy arrays

Compute minimum, maximum, and average salaries

Measure salary variation using standard deviation and variance

Filter employees with high salaries

Simulate future salary growth with percentage increments

⚙️ Tools & Technologies

Python

NumPy

Jupyter Notebook

📊 Analysis Performed

Basic Statistical Analysis

Total number of employees

Minimum, maximum, and average salary

Salary Distribution

Standard Deviation and Variance

Interpreted how salary spread varies across employees

Filtering High Salaries

Extracted employees earning above ₹50,000

Future Salary Growth Simulation

Simulated a 5-year salary growth assuming a 5% annual increment

💡 Key Insights

Salaries vary significantly (₹10,000 – ₹90,000)

High standard deviation indicates a wide salary range

Employees earning above ₹50,000 form the higher-income group

Over 5 years, salaries increase notably with consistent growth

🧠 Learning Outcome

This project enhanced understanding of:

NumPy array operations

Statistical functions and vectorized calculations

Data handling in Python
